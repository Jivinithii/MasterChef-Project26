
Instructions

    Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Mix flour, baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Set aside. Beat butter and sugars in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until well mixed. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts, if desired.

    Drop by rounded tablespoons about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.

    Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.

    For extra thrill, turn chocolate chips into spiders! Before baking, press a few extra chocolate chips into the top of each cookie. Remove hot baked cookies from the oven and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Using a toothpick, draw 8 spider legs on each exposed chocolate chip by pulling the melted chocolate out into squiggly lines.
